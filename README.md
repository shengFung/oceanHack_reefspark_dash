# 🌊 ReefSpark — Turning Ocean Data Into Insights

**ReefSpark** is a platform built for the **Ocean Hackathon** that transforms messy, hard-to-use datasets into clean, visual, and intelligent insights.

## 💡 Concept
Many ocean and reef datasets are large, inconsistent, or even crash ordinary computers. ReefSpark acts as a **bridge between data and solutions** — helping researchers, developers, and innovators use ocean data without the technical pain.

## ⚙️ What We Do
- 🧹 **Clean messy data** — handle missing values, merge formats, and reduce size.  
- 📊 **Turn data into graphs & visualizations** — making trends easy to understand.  
- 🔍 **Provide smart tools** — search, sort, and filter through complex datasets easily.  
- 🧠 **Predictive insights** — use machine learning to forecast ocean or reef conditions.  
- 💬 **LLM-powered Q&A** — our integrated AI assistant answers questions directly from the data, even for users unfamiliar with graphs or analysis.

## 🌐 Our Vision
To become the **middleman between problem and solution** — helping others use ocean data to build innovations, apps, or research outcomes that protect and understand marine ecosystems.
